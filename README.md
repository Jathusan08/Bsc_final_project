# Bsc_final_project

This final year project is based on what I have learned and gained new skills during the last three years of studying Computer Science BSc Honours. As a computer science student my main interest is always has been on mobile application development. Therefore, I will be developing a mobile application which will be based on campus navigation, as this is one of real issue that students and others currently experiencing. The current situation is that there are no existing programme or application to solve this.
J2 is a campus navigator specifically created for students and others who is having difficulties to find directions inside University of Westminster Cavendish campus. The campus navigator does not require any knowledge as it very easy to use and anyone can use it. In order to develop this application, I have chosen android for my project as it one of the popular mobile operating system around the world, wanted to gain new knowledge and experience which will be beneficial for my future career.
